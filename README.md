# E-commerce-Website
This project is a frontend e-commerce website built using React.js, designed to provide a seamless and interactive shopping experience. It features a modern responsive UI, ensuring accessibility across different devices. The website uses React Router DOM for smooth navigation between pages and React Hooks like useState and useEffect for state management. Users can browse a variety of products, view details, and manage their shopping experience with an "Add to Cart".
I also added wishlist feature, the wishlist feature allows users to save their favorite products for future reference. When a user clicks the "Add to Wishlist" button on a product, it gets stored in the wishlist section. Additionally, when a user clicks on the "Proceed to Checkout" button, an alert message appears to confirm the action.
